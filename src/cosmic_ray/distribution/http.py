"""Cosmic Ray distributor that sends work requests over HTTP to workers.

This uses a list of URLs to workes, distributing work to them as they're available.

Enabling the distributor
========================

To use the http distributor, set ``cosmic-ray.distributor.name = "http"`` in your Cosmic Ray configuration, and
configure the list of worker URLs in ``cosmic-ray.distributor.http.worker-urls``:

.. code-block:: toml

    [cosmic-ray.distributor]
    name = "http"

    [cosmic-ray.distributor.http]
    worker-urls = ['http://localhost:9876', 'http://localhost:9877']
