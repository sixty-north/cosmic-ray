        An operator might be able to mutate a node in multiple ways, and this
        function should produce a position description for each of these
        mutations. Critically, if an operator can make multiple mutations to the
        same position, this should produce a position for each of these
        mutations (i.e. multiple identical positions).

            node: The AST node being mutated.

            An iterable of ``((start-line, start-col), (stop-line, stop-col))``
