    tests, and report the results.

    This is fundamentally the single-mutation-and-test-run process
    implementation.

    There are three high-level ways that a worker can finish. First, it could
    fail exceptionally, meaning that some uncaught exception made its way from
    some part of the operation to terminate the function. This function will
    intercept all exceptions and return it in a non-exceptional structure.

    Second, the mutation testing machinery may determine that there is no
    OCCURENCE-th instance for OPERATOR_NAME in the module under test. In this
    case there is no way to report a test result (i.e. killed, survived, or
    incompetent) so a special value is returned indicating that no mutation is
    possible.

    Finally, and hopefully normally, the worker will find that it can run a
    test. It will do so and report back the result - killed, survived, or
    incompetent - in a structured way.

    Returns: a WorkItem

    Raises: This will generally not raise any exceptions. Rather, exceptions
        will be reported using the 'exception' result-type in the return value.
