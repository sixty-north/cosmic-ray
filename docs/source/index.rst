Cosmic Ray: mutation testing for Python
=======================================

*"Four human beings -- changed by space-born cosmic rays into something more than merely human."*
*â€” The Fantastic Four*

Cosmic Ray is a mutation testing tool for Python 3. It makes small changes to
your source code, running your test suite for each one. If a test suite passes
on mutated code, then you have a mismatch between your tests and your
functionality.

Cosmic Ray has been successfully used on a wide variety of projects ranging from
assemblers to oil exploration software.
