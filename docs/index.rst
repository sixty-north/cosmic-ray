Cosmic Ray: mutation testing for Python
=======================================

*"Four human beings -- changed by space-born cosmic rays into something more than merely human."*
*— The Fantastic Four*

Cosmic Ray is a tool for performing mutation testing on Python
code.

N.B.! Cosmic Ray is still learning how to walk!
-----------------------------------------------

At this time Cosmic Ray is young and incomplete. It doesn't support all of the
mutations it should, its output format is crude, it only supports some forms of
test discovery, it may fall over on exotic modules...\ `the list goes on and on
<https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray/issues>`__. Still, for the
adventurous it *does* work. Hopefully things will improve fairly rapidly.

And, of course, patches and ideas are welcome.

**This documentation is a bit out of date, but we're working to get it in good order!**
